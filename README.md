## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-xsp using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-xsp
```

## Use

Then generate your new project:

```bash
mkdir my-new-proj
cd my-new-proj
yo xsp
```

## Import to [IBM Domino Designer](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/dominodesigner/)

Importing your On Disk Project (ODP) into IBM Domino Designer is the end-goal. This will not work as a full application in its NSF container without being interacted with from a Domino Designer instance.

If you need help getting started with source control and its relationship to Domino/XPages applicaitons, you may wish to get started at [Notes in 9 episode 131: Use SourceTree for Better XPages Source Control](http://www.notesin9.com/2013/11/12/notesin9-131-use-sourcetree-for-better-xpages-source-control/).

### Sub-Generators

A sub-generator is one that creates/scaffolds a _part_ or _parts_ of an _app_. By default, yeoman will generator the entirety of the defined _app_. For example, if one were to [look at generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#generators), you would find that you can scaffold an _app_ or a specific _directive_ or _filter_, etc. The format of this follows the basics of `yo xsp:<sub-generator>`.

Available are:

- XPages, `yo xsp:xpage`
- Custom Controls, `yo xsp:cc`
- Java `Class`es, `yo xsp:class`
- Java `Class`es configured as beans, `yo xsp:bean`
- a `CustomRestService` bean and integration into an `api.xsp` XPage via `xe:restService`, `yo xsp:rest`
